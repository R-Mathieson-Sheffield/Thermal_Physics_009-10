<h2>Intro<a class="headerlink" href="#intro" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In this lecture we are going to pick up from the <a class="reference internal" href="Lecture_6_Thermal_Conduction.html#tps-topic6"><span class="std std-ref">last topic</span></a> where we were looking at mechanisms of heat conduction in materials, and now consider two other types of heat transfer: convection and radiation. In doing so we are going to be looking at some relationships that extend beyond what you may consider to fall within the scope of general thermodynamics such as how radiative heat transfer can be applied in the study of astrophysics.</p>
</section>
<section id="convection">
<h2>Convection<a class="headerlink" href="#convection" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Convection is the mechanism by which heat is transferred through fluids, where a fluid may be either a liquid or a gas.</p>
<p>The Met Office defines convection as “<strong>the transfer of heat by the circulation or movement of heated parts of a liquid or gas” or “the movement within a liquid or a gas driven by differences in temperature</strong>”. You may be thankful to know that you will not be asked to perform any calculations for a convection heat transfer and this is because it is extremely difficult to do so.</p>
<p>Convection is a chaotic system meaning that making very small changes to the starting parameters of our model will result in drastic changes in the system as it evolves over time.
If we consider the MET office again, when modelling weather patterns and extrapolating forwards to make predictions, they must take into consideration chaotic systems such as convection and turbulence.</p>
<p>To help aid these calculations they use a supercomputer called the cray XC40, which is capable of making 14,000 trillion arithmetic calculations per second! This would be the same as every person on the earth performing over 2 million calculations per second.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>But even with this level of calculation weather predictions can often be inaccurate, due to the chaotic nature of the system being studied¬</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Thanks to these computers, the MET uses 215 billion weather measurements from across the globe every day to act as the starting point for their atmospheric models for weather predictions.</p>
<p><strong>So what are the actual mechanics driving convection currents?</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>There is a source of heat that supplies energy to one particular spot. For example, if we have a large water bath and place an immersion heater element in the middle of it, that spot in the middle is going to receive the majority of the heat supplied.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that only the water immediately next to the heating element is going to be heated significantly compared to the rest of the water in this large water bath.</p></li>
<li><p>If we provide heat energy we are going to increase the kinetic energy of the molecules in this region which in turn is going to increase the amount of volume that they occupy. As the mass of water being heated has not changed, but the volume has increased, the density of this heated water is reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>Denser materials sink and less dense materials rise meaning the heated water rises and the volume it occupies is replaced with cooler water that can be then be heated.</p></li>
<li><p>As the hot water rises, it spreads out and dissipates its energy with the rest of the fluid causing it to cool down and again become more dense causing it to begin to sink. This constant rising and falling of the hot and cooling fluid is what we describe as a convection current.</p></li>

<h3>Convection Current Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#convection-current-examples" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Here we can see a model of the convection currents in the earth’s mantle that nicely demonstrates this localised heating, rising and falling.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="fig-convection">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Convection.png"><img alt="A 2D image showing a simulation of thermal convection in the Earth's mantle. The image is dominated by blue swirls, representing cooler regions. There are several vertical bands of yellow and red, indicating hotter regions. These bands rise upwards, creating a pattern of convection cells where warm material rises, cools, and then sinks back down, repeating the cycle. The horizontal axis is labeled &quot;x (km)&quot; and the vertical axis is labeled &quot;z (km)&quot;, representing depth. The title of the image is &quot;Thermal convection, constant viscosity.&quot;" src="_images/Convection.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>

<p>Another example of a convection current that you may be familiar with is a land/sea breeze, which can be created under the right conditions:</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="fig-seabreeze">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/SeaBreeze.png"><img alt="A diagram showing how land and sea breezes form. The top half of the diagram shows a day scene. The sun is shining on a coastline. An arrow shows warm air rising from the land towards the sea. Another arrow shows cooler air blowing from the sea towards the land, labeled &quot;cool sea breeze.&quot; The bottom half of the diagram shows a night scene. The moon is in the sky. An arrow shows warm air rising from the sea towards the land.

<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 26 </span><span class="caption-text">A diagram illustrating the formation of land and sea breezes. During the day, the land heats up faster than the sea, creating a low-pressure area over the land. This causes cooler air from the sea to flow inland as a sea breeze. At night, the land cools down faster than the sea, creating a high-pressure area over the land. This causes cooler air from the land to flow towards the sea as a land breeze.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#fig-seabreeze" title="Link to this image">#</a></p>

<li><p>The opposite is true in the daytime. The land is heated up by the sun much more rapidly than the sea, causing the air above the land to heat up more quickly relative to the air above the sea.

<p>Convection currents are very important when modelling climate and weather systems and they can be seen to operate on a global scale.  As the sun heats the surface of the earth, the air above the surface is heated and rises, and under certain conditions this air can continue to rise to form different types of clouds, which obviously impact the weather.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a process known as the ocean conveyor current, which is a water current that carries warmer water from the equator of the planet to the poles. This process is impacted by convection due to the ocean temperature and the salinity (salt concentration) of the water. Warm waters near the equator are pushed towards the poles by strong wind patterns, and are carried to the higher latitudes where they cool via interaction with the colder winds. The water also evaporates during this movement, which in turn increases the salt concentration of the water.</p>
<p>This increase in salinity and decrease in temperature causes the water to sink through a convection process. This is vital for driving ocean currents as it supplies water to deep water currents which then transport the water back to the tropical regions. These systems are very complicated and are made even more difficult when considering the coriolis force caused by the Earth’s rotation.</p>
<p>If the earth did not rotate, the atmosphere would simply cycle from the high pressure regions at the poles to the low pressure regions at the equator and back again, however due to the earth’s rotation, the air is deflected. If the air is travelling from the north pole to the equator, it is deflected west, whereas if it is travelling from the equator to the north pole it is deflected to the east. The opposite is true for the south pole. Clearly this just adds another level of complexity that makes modelling large climate systems more difficult.</p>
<p>Now that we have a good overview of conduction and convection, it is time to look at the final mechanism for heat transfer - radiation!</p>

<h2>Radiation<a class="headerlink" href="#radiation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Simply put, all objects emit electromagnetic radiation and the peak wavelength they emit is dependent on the temperature of the object.</p>

<p>You will have seen images like those above before where we show the temperature of an object/person or cow, using a thermal camera. These simply measure the wavelength of light being emitted by the object in the non-visible region of the spectrum and apply a colour scale so that we are able to differentiate between the different temperatures visibly.</p>
<p>You may recall that during the pandemic it was common to use non-contact thermometers to determine the body temperature of a person to gauge if they have a fever. These thermometers focus the infrared radiation that we radiate onto a sensor in order to determine skin temperature. The cow and the person here show this nicely, with yellows, reds and whites representing hot regions on the object and the greens, blues and blacks representing the cooler regions.</p>
<p>We are also aware that we do not need a thermal imaging camera to know that what we have said here is true, as we heat an object to a higher and higher temperature, eventually the electromagnetic wave it emits will fall within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, the image above shows a blacksmith working on a glowing red hot piece of metal. In the lightbulb, we run a high current through the wire which causes resistive heating until the tungsten filament is so hot it begins to glow and produce enough light to illuminate a room. Things become red hot at around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(800\,^\circ\text{C}\)</span> and white hot at around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3000\,^\circ\text{C}\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Blackbody Radiation<a class="headerlink" href="#blackbody-radiation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Now, when we want to perform calculations to determine the temperature of an object from the wavelength of radiation it emits, we do so assuming that it is a <strong>blackbody radiator</strong>.</p>
<p>A blackbody radiator is a hypothetical object that emits and absorbs all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. In reality, there are no ideal black bodies, but there are some examples that are good approximations.</p>
<p>The best example is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), more commonly referred to as “the afterglow of the big bang”. If you ever watched an analogue TV (and it scares me slightly that you might be young enough to not have!) that was not tuned to a channel you would have seen TV static - this is the jumping black and white dots that flicker on the screen - part of this static pattern may be attributed to the cosmic microwave background. The CMB is shown below:</p>

<p class="admonition-title">What is the Cosmic Microwave Background?</p>
<p><strong>This is not examinable, but is included for your interest.</strong></p>
<p>In 1965, Arno Penzais and Robert Wilson were working on satellite communication technologies at Bell labs in the states. When doing this they turned on a microwave antenna and pointed it towards the sky only to find that the signals they detected had no directional preference (e.g. they measured the same sort of signal regardless of where the detector was pointed. Analysis of these signals by physicists showed that the wavelength of the microwave signals detected correspond to a temperature of around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.725\text{ K}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(380000\)</span> years after the big bang, the universe cooled to a toasty <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3000\text{ K}\)</span>, which allowed for the the formation of neutral atoms for the first time, and consequently, the universe became transparent to most light. As we will learn in our final unit, electrons in atoms can be exited between energy states via absorption of photons of specific wavelengths. The atom is therefore opaque to these wavelengths (as it absorbs them) but transparent to others. Prior to the formation of atoms, photons would simply scatter off of the free electrons and protons.</p>
<p>This <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3000\text{ K}\)</span> blackbody radiation therefore “survived” and as the universe expanded it cooled to its current temperature of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.725\text{ K}\)</span>. On this map of the CMB, you will see hotter and cooler areas. In these slightly cooler regions, the density of matter was greater which allowed for the formation of galaxies such as the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The CMB is the best direct evidence of the big bang theory. In summary - the CMB is the best example of a blackbody radiator, which itself is an idealised object that can perfectly absorb or emit all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
</div>
<p>Now we have established what a blackbody radiator is, we can begin to investigate the relationship between the wavelength of light that an object emits and its temperature.</p>

<h2>The Planck Curve<a class="headerlink" href="#the-planck-curve" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>An object at a given temperature will radiate electromagnetic radiation, however it does not emit a single wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, instead it radiates a distribution of wavelengths, the intensities of which vary as a function of temperature.</p>

</aside>
<p>We can plot the <strong>spectral radiance</strong> as a function of wavelength for an object at various temperatures to see how this changes.

In essence it is a  measure of intensity. The diagram below is known as a Planck curve and illustrates how the spectral radiance varies as a function of temperature:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What we notice is that as the temperature of a body increases, the peak wavelength of the light it emits increases in intensity and is shifted towards the lower wavelengths (e.g. higher frequencies/energies).
This is a very important relationship to remember and one that can only be explained based on the teachings of quantum mechanics. The black line on this plot shows the prediction made using Classical theory (e.g. not quantum theory) - we see that as the wavelength emitted by the object gets smaller and smaller into the ultraviolet region, the intensity of its spectral radiance increases exponentially to infinity!</p>
<p>This means that if we were to integrate under the curve to find the total radiated intensity, it would also be equal to infinity - this is clearly not possible. Lord Rayleigh who derived this classical model referred to this as the “ultraviolet catastrophe”.</p>
<p>Plancks’ model based on quantum mechanics was not favoured at the time even by himself - in a letter to his friend he called it “an act of desperation” into which he was forced because “a theoretical explanation had to be found at any cost, regardless of the price”. Only five years later with the  Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect amongst other evidence, did the validity of quantum theory become accepted.</p>

<p>The total power of a star is simply the amount of energy it emits in a given unit of time (recall that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P = \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}\)</span>). In astronomy this is often just called the luminosity of the star.  Using Stefan’s law we are able to determine the surface temperature of a star from its luminosity.</p>
<p>We can see from this diagram that if we plot a star’s luminosity (in this case measured relative to the sun) as a function of its surface temperature, the stars fall within different clusters depending on the type of star they are. For example, white dwarves, main sequence stars, red or blue giants or supergiants.</p>

</div>
<p>The middle strip of this plot shows main sequence stars such as the sun. These are the most numerous stars in the universe and maintain themselves by fusing hydrogen into helium in their core. This generates a radiation pressure that exerts and outwards in order to counteract the gravitational collapse of the star inward.</p>
<p>Once almost all of the hydrogen has been used up, the fusion pressure in the core drops and the core of the star collapses under its gravitational forces, this increases the temperature of the core which allows hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core to begin to fuse, which causes the star to expand. As the core continues to collapse and become more and more dense, the outer shells of the star expand further and further until the star becomes a red giant.</p>
<p>Low mass main sequence stars are unable to become red giants and instead will continue to fuse hydrogen for up to a trillion years - the current age of the universe is 13.7 billion years for reference! If the star is sufficiently heavy (above 8-10 solar masses) once the core of the star has fused into helium, the gravitational forces acting on the core are sufficient to fuse heavier elements until eventually the core is formed of iron (no more fusion can take place at this point as we will learn later this semester). At the end of the lifetime of the star, these super giants will go supernova and depending on their mass produce either a neutron star or a blackhole. Stars with masses less than 10 solar masses cannot go supernova and instead they just slowly lose their outer layers leaving behind only the core of the star - this is known as a white dwarf star.</p>

Solution</label><div class="sd-tab-content docutils">
<p>To answer this question, we make the assumption that the Earth behaves as a perfect blackbody. As the Sun’s radiation intercepts the Earth in parallel lines (i.e. not radially towards the centre of the Earth), the area used in this calculation will be the cross sectional area, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_c\)</span>, rather than half the surface area:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{align*}
A_c = \pi r^2
\end{align*}\]</div>
<p>Looking at the units of the solar radiation intensity, it is clear that if multiplied by an area we will get the corresponding amount of power incident upon the earth:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{align*}
P &amp;= I A_c\\
    &amp;= I \pi r^2
\end{align*}\]</div>
<p>The question also states that the same amount of power is radiated back into space, therefore we can equate the power above to the power given using Stefan’s law:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{align*}
P = A \sigma T^4
\end{align*}\]</div>
<p>however the Earth will radiate this energy back into space in all direction, therefore the area we use in this equation is now the full surface area of the Earth:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{align*}
P = (4 \pi r^2) \sigma T^4
\end{align*}\]</div>
<p>As the two powers are the same (power incident on Earth = power emitted by Earth) we can state:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{align*}
I \pi r^2 &amp;= (4 \pi r^2) \sigma T^4\\
\therefore I &amp;= 4 \sigma T^4\\
\text{or } T &amp;= ^4\sqrt{\frac{I}{4\sigma}}\\
    &amp;= ^4\sqrt{\frac{1370}{4\times 5.67\times 10^{-8}}}\\
