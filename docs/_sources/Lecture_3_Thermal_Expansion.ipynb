    "## Thermal Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [last topic](TPS_Topic2) we began to look at thermometry which is based on measuring thermetric properties. One such thermetric property is that of thermal expansion and contraction - the change in dimensions of an object as a function of its temperature. This is one of the topics that we are going to look at today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding thermal expansions is not only limited to thermometry, but also in everyday life and how we engineer the world around us. For example, consider the climate in the UK, the coldest temperature ever recorded was $-27.2\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and the hottest ever recorded temperature was $40.3\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. This is a temperature difference of $67.5\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$!\n",
    "\n",
    "When engineers are designing infrastructure projects, considerations must be taken to account for the fact that the infrastructure will need to operate in vastly different temperature ranges without failure.  An example of this is shown below where the design of a bridge incorporates an expansion joint, which prevents the bridge from buckling in high temperatures as it has been designed to accommodate a thermal expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} Figures/ThermalExpansionExamples.png\n",
    ":name: fig_ThermalExpansionExamples\n",
    ":alt: There are two photograph images presented. The left is a close-up of an expansion joint on a bridge. The joint consists of a series of metal plates with gaps between them, allowing the bridge to expand and contract with changes in temperature. The right is a photograph of a railroad track winding through a rural landscape. The track curves gently through fields and trees.\n",

    "Two real world examples of thermal expansion. The left image shows an expansion joint on a bridge, allowing for thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge deck. The right is a railroad track with that should be a lot straighter but thes image shows a railroad track with several curves, demonstrating how the track has warped as it tries to exapand but has buckled instead.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can see an example of where train tracks have buckled. Network rail aims to prevent buckling by painting some rails paler colours so they absorb less heat, reduce the speed at which trains can travel over rails in hot conditions and introduce small gaps in the rails for them to expand into. Even so this is not always sufficient, and tracks may need replacing, which means that trains are unable to run and the efficiency of the network is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now consider the physics that is actually taking place when materials undergo thermal expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand thermal expansion, we must look at the bulk materials on a much smaller scale. Let us consider a block of metal - if we zoom in on the structure of the metal we will find atoms arranged within a lattice (a repeating structural unit of atoms):\n",

    "As these atoms have energy, they will vibrate around their equilibrium positions. If these are supplied with more heat (e.g. from the environment on a hot sunny day), the temperature of the metal will increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we learnt in the last lecture, temperature is directly related to the kinetic energy of the atoms, and if this increases, so does the amplitude of the atomic oscillations. This results in a larger average distance between the atoms and correspondingly and expansion of the metal. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can again assume that over a given temperature range, the amount of expansion is linearly proportional to the temperature of the material. We can also assume that the expansion would be proportional to the original length of the material. These assumptions can be expressed mathematically as:\n",

For example, consider if you already had an object at absolute zero and brought into contact with a body you wanted to cool to absolute zero, the two bodies would heat and cool until they reach thermal equilibrium, which will be above absolute zero.

    "Using this law we are able to make measurements of temperature using the setup shown. Here we have a bulb containing a gas submerged in the environment we are going to measure. This gas bulb is directly connected to a column of mercury that is again directly connected to a second reservoir of mercury. \n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to maintain the level of the mercury in the first column (A) relative to an external scale by moving the mercury in the second column (B). As the gas heats, it pushes the mercury in the first column down and increases the level of the mercury in the second column. Once equilibrium has been reached, the second column (B) is physically raised until the mercury in the first column returns to its original position. This ensures that as the gas heats up, the volume it occupies remains constant and the pressure of the gas increases.  The difference in height of the mercury of the second column (B) is then recorded. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the height of the mercury in the second reservoir is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas in the fixed volume, which itself is directly proportional to the temperature of the environment being measured. \n",

    "\n",
    "Our final way of measuring temperature is via pyrometry, which is the technique we used to measure extremely high temperatures where it is not physically possible to get a thermometer into contact with the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique effectively uses the light emitted by the hot body to determine its temperature, for example an optical pyrometer will focus the light emitted by the glowing body onto a photodiode, which then produces a voltage proportional to the temperature of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more analogue example of a pyrometer is that of the disappearing filament. Effectively, as we increase the current flowing through a filament of wire, we increase its temperature and cause it to glow due to resistive heating. The higher the current, the more brightly the filament will glow! If we then place this filament in front of the object whose temperature we would like to gauge, we can adjust the current until the glow of the filament matches that of the hot object and they become indistinguishable from one another. The current flowing through the wire is then a measure of the temperature of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using pyrometers is that as they are non-contact, they do not change the temperature of the thing that you are measuring, they can be operated safely as they do not need to be directly exposed to high temperatures which may damage them and they respond to changes in temperature relatively quickly.
