    "## Convection\n",
    "\n",
    "Convection is the mechanism by which heat is transferred through fluids, where a fluid may be either a liquid or a gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Met Office defines convection as “**the transfer of heat by the circulation or movement of heated parts of a liquid or gas” or “the movement within a liquid or a gas driven by differences in temperature**”. You may be thankful to know that you will not be asked to perform any calculations for a convection heat transfer and this is because it is extremely difficult to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convection is a chaotic system meaning that making very small changes to the starting parameters of our model will result in drastic changes in the system as it evolves over time. \n",
    "If we consider the MET office again, when modelling weather patterns and extrapolating forwards to make predictions, they must take into consideration chaotic systems such as convection and turbulence. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help aid these calculations they use a supercomputer called the cray XC40, which is capable of making 14,000 trillion arithmetic calculations per second! This would be the same as every person on the earth performing over 2 million calculations per second. \n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "But even with this level of calculation weather predictions can often be inaccurate, due to the chaotic nature of the system being studied¬\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "Thanks to these computers, the MET uses 215 billion weather measurements from across the globe every day to act as the starting point for their atmospheric models for weather predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So what are the actual mechanics driving convection currents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a source of heat that supplies energy to one particular spot. For example, if we have a large water bath and place an immersion heater element in the middle of it, that spot in the middle is going to receive the majority of the heat supplied. \n",
    "2. This means that only the water immediately next to the heating element is going to be heated significantly compared to the rest of the water in this large water bath.\n",
    "3. If we provide heat energy we are going to increase the kinetic energy of the molecules in this region which in turn is going to increase the amount of volume that they occupy. As the mass of water being heated has not changed, but the volume has increased, the density of this heated water is reduced. \n",
    "4. Denser materials sink and less dense materials rise meaning the heated water rises and the volume it occupies is replaced with cooler water that can be then be heated.\n",
    "5. As the hot water rises, it spreads out and dissipates its energy with the rest of the fluid causing it to cool down and again become more dense causing it to begin to sink. This constant rising and falling of the hot and cooling fluid is what we describe as a convection current.\n",

These bands rise upwards, creating a pattern of convection cells where warm material rises, cools, and then sinks back down, repeating the cycle. The horizontal axis is labeled \"x (km)\" and the vertical axis is labeled \"z (km)\", representing depth. The title of the image is \"Thermal convection, constant viscosity.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Another example of a convection current that you may be familiar with is a land/sea breeze, which can be created under the right conditions:\n",

An arrow shows warm air rising from the land towards the sea. Another arrow shows cooler air blowing from the sea towards the land, labeled \"cool sea breeze.\" The bottom half of the diagram shows a night scene. The moon is in the sky. An arrow shows warm air rising from the sea towards the land. Another arrow shows cooler air blowing from the land towards the sea, labeled \"cool land breeze.\"\n",

This causes cooler air from the sea to flow inland as a sea breeze. At night, the land cools down faster than the sea, creating a high-pressure area over the land. This causes cooler air from the land to flow towards the sea as a land breeze.\n",

    "- At night time, the land cools relatively quickly, but the warmer water heats the air above it, increasing the temperature of the air above the sea relative to the land.

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Convection currents are very important when modelling climate and weather systems and they can be seen to operate on a global scale.  As the sun heats the surface of the earth, the air above the surface is heated and rises, and under certain conditions this air can continue to rise to form different types of clouds, which obviously impact the weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there is a process known as the ocean conveyor current, which is a water current that carries warmer water from the equator of the planet to the poles. This process is impacted by convection due to the ocean temperature and the salinity (salt concentration) of the water. Warm waters near the equator are pushed towards the poles by strong wind patterns, and are carried to the higher latitudes where they cool via interaction with the colder winds. The water also evaporates during this movement, which in turn increases the salt concentration of the water. \n",
    "\n",
    "This increase in salinity and decrease in temperature causes the water to sink through a convection process. This is vital for driving ocean currents as it supplies water to deep water currents which then transport the water back to the tropical regions. These systems are very complicated and are made even more difficult when considering the coriolis force caused by the Earth’s rotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the earth did not rotate, the atmosphere would simply cycle from the high pressure regions at the poles to the low pressure regions at the equator and back again, however due to the earth's rotation, the air is deflected. If the air is travelling from the north pole to the equator, it is deflected west, whereas if it is travelling from the equator to the north pole it is deflected to the east. The opposite is true for the south pole. Clearly this just adds another level of complexity that makes modelling large climate systems more difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a good overview of conduction and convection, it is time to look at the final mechanism for heat transfer - radiation!"

    "You may recall that during the pandemic it was common to use non-contact thermometers to determine the body temperature of a person to gauge if they have a fever. These thermometers focus the infrared radiation that we radiate onto a sensor in order to determine skin temperature. The cow and the person here show this nicely, with yellows, reds and whites representing hot regions on the object and the greens, blues and blacks representing the cooler regions. \n",

    "We are also aware that we do not need a thermal imaging camera to know that what we have said here is true, as we heat an object to a higher and higher temperature, eventually the electromagnetic wave it emits will fall within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, the image above shows a blacksmith working on a glowing red hot piece of metal. In the lightbulb, we run a high current through the wire which causes resistive heating until the tungsten filament is so hot it begins to glow and produce enough light to illuminate a room.

If you ever watched an analogue TV (and it scares me slightly that you might be young enough to not have!) that was not tuned to a channel you would have seen TV static - this is the jumping black and white dots that flicker on the screen - part of this static pattern may be attributed to the cosmic microwave background.

When doing this they turned on a microwave antenna and pointed it towards the sky only to find that the signals they detected had no directional preference (e.g. they measured the same sort of signal regardless of where the detector was pointed. Analysis of these signals by physicists showed that the wavelength of the microwave signals detected correspond to a temperature of around $2.725\\text{ K}$.\n",

    "Around $380000$ years after the big bang, the universe cooled to a toasty $3000\\text{ K}$, which allowed for the the formation of neutral atoms for the first time, and consequently, the universe became transparent to most light. As we will learn in our final unit, electrons in atoms can be exited between energy states via absorption of photons of specific wavelengths. The atom is therefore opaque to these wavelengths (as it absorbs them) but transparent to others. Prior to the formation of atoms, photons would simply scatter off of the free electrons and protons.\n",
