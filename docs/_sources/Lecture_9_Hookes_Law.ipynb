It has been **elastically** deformed. An easy example to remember this is to consider an “elastic material” such as a rubber band. If we stretch it and let go, it will return to its original shape. \n",

Up to moderate strains (small changes in length) a metal may behave elastically and return to its original shape, but under large strains (large changes in length) the material will not. \n",

    "## Hooke's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hooke’s law experiment is a classic physics classroom experiment as all you need to perform it is a spring and some masses. In the experiment you secure the spring vertically to a clamp stand, measure its initial length, add a mass ($f = ma$), which intuitively will cause the spring to stretch and its length to increase. By measuring the new length the extension of the spring can be determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally if more masses are added, the force acting on the spring increases as does the magnitude of the extenion. Therefore **the extension is proportional to the force applied to the spring** - yhis is Hooke’s law, and it can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "F \\propto \\Delta x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a linearly proportional relationship, naturally we introduce a constant of proportionality, $k$, which in this case is the spring constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "F = k \\Delta x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooke’s law does not only apply to springs and can apply to other elastically deformable materials. If we look at the form of this equation we notice that it is a linear relationship. However, in the spring extension experiment one will find that as masses keep being added, the extension of the material does not continue to vary linearly. This Hooke’s law can only describe a system when it is behaving linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooke's law relates force to extension. In the [last topic](TPS_Topic8) we introduced the concepts of stress and strain, which themselves can be written in terms of force and extension respectively:\n",

    "```{math}\n",
    "\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\quad &\\therefore F = \\sigma A\\\\\n",
