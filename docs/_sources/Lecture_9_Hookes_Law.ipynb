    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be able to define elastic and plastic deformation.\n",
    "- Be able to draw an annotated stress/strain curve.\n",
    "- Be able to calculate the Young modulus of various materials and use this in further calculations.\n",
    "- Be able to calculate the energy stored in a material under stress.\n",
    "- Be able to calculate the speed of sound in different materials.\n",

    "## Elastic and Plastic Deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply a force to a material and this changes its size, if we remove the force and the object returns to its original size, we say that it is behaving elastically. It has been *elastically* deformed. An easy example to remember this is to consider an “elastic material” such as a rubber band. If we stretch it and let go, it will return to its original shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, if we remove the force acting on an object and it does not return to its original shape, we say that it is behaving plastically. It has been *plastically* deformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A material does not have to behave either elastically or plastically, it may depend on the load that is applied. Under moderate strains (small changes in length) a metal may return to its original shape, but under large strains (large changes in length) the meterial will not. \n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour can be determined by looking at stress-strain curves as you will see shortly. We are going to consider how a spring may behaves as we apply different amounts of tensile force to it, which nicely leads us onto Hooke’s Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hooke's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hooke’s law experiment is a classic physics classroom experiment as all you need to perform it is a spring and some masses. In the experiment you secure the spring vertically to a clamp stand, measure its initial length, add a mass ($f = ma$), which intuitively will cause the spring to stretch and its length to increase. By measuring the new length the extension of the spring can be determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally if more masses are added, the force acting on the spring increases as does the magnitude of the extenion. Therefore **the extension is proportional to the force applied to the spring**. - This is Hooke’s law, and it can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F \\propto \\Delta x. $\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a linearly proportional relationship, naturally we introduce a constant of proportionality, $k$, which in this case is the spring constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F = k \\Delta x $\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooke’s law does not only apply to springs and can apply to other elastically deformable materials. If we look at the form of this equation we notice that it is a linear relationship. However, in the spring extension experiment one will find that as masses keep being added, the extension of the material does not continue to occur linearly. This Hooke’s law can only describe a system when it is behaving linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hookes law relates force to extension. In the last lecture we introduced the concepts of stress and strain, which themselves can be written in terms of force and extension respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\to F = \\sigma A, $\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0} \\to \\Delta L = \\epsilon L_0,$\n",
    "\n",
    "as such Hooke's law can be expressed in terms of stress and strain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F = k \\Delta L \\to \\sigma A = k \\epsilon L_0, $\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be rearranged to make strain the subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma  = \\frac{k L_0}{A}\\epsilon, $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore for Hooke’s law to be valid stress must be proportional strain!** The constant of proportionality is equal to kL0 / A. Lets see what this looks like for a material on a stress strain plot. \n",
