    "These notes are provided to help supliment your lectures and should act as a useful tool for your understanding and revision. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These notes contain worked solutions to example problems.** These problems may be identical to those from the lectures, otherwise the same bar changes in values, or new. It is worth attempting the questions even if you recognise them from the lectures as it will help consolidate your learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensure you try to answer the questions before looking at the solutions**. Research has shown that when students simply look at the solutions they get a false sense of understanding e.g \"Yes, that is what I would have done.\", but when tested are unable to perform as they haven't gone through the process of actually learning the steps to answering the questions themselves! \n",
