If we lower the piston we are reducing the volume in which the gas can occupy.  This means that the gas molecules are more likely to collide with one another and the surface of the container in which they are held, thus the pressure that they exert on the walls of the container increases. The opposite is true if we extract the piston from the chamber. In this case the volume of the chamber increases and the pressure the gas exerts on the walls of the container decreases. \n",

As we are again assuming that none of the gas molecules escape, as the gas heats up their kinetic energy increases and the gas expands. The only way of maintaining a constant pressure in this scenario is for the gas in the chamber to raise the piston and increase the volume of the cylinder. \n",

This equation is entirely consistent with the one that we defined above, and we can show this by introducing Avagadro's number, $N_\\text{A}$. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. The ideal gas particles are \"point-like\" and have no volume. A consequence of the particles are small compared to the container they are stored in and the average distance between particles.\n",

At lower temperatures, perhaps close to the condensation point, the kinetic energy of the gas particles is much lower and they move much more slowly. Now the intermolecular forces acting between molecules is no longer negligable as assumed by the ideal gas model. In this scenario, the real gas will no longer behave like an ideal gas.  \n",

Therefore we can use Boyles' law relating pressure and volume at the top ($T$) and bottom ($B$) of the mountain:\n",
