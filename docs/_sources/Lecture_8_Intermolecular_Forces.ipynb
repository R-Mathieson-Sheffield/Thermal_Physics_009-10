    "On the other hand, for liquids and solids the molecules are far closer together and interact with one another via intermolecular forces. These are not to be confused with intramolecular forces (those that bind the atoms together in molecules), which are much stronger. These intermolecular forces are simply caused by the interactions between the electrically charged constituents of the molecules. \n",
    "\n",
    "These intermolecular forces only act between molecules when they are in close proximity to one another. Therefore we can conclude that forces between molecules are attractive at short distances only. **We define the attractive force acting between molecules to be negative** as they act to **reduce** intermolecular distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider a material, we must also recall that the majority of matter is empty space, from which we can conclude that there must be some force that prevents atoms/molecules from getting too close to one another. Therefore at very short ranges, the force acting between molecules must be repulsive. **We define the repulsive force acting between molecules to be positive.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The red line in {numref}`fig_IntermolecularForcePlot` represents the sum of the attractive and repulsive forces. As the molecules are brought closer together, they become more strongly attracted to one another (the force becomes increasingly negative), however as the separation reduces even further, the force begins to become less negative and the positive attraction between the molecules begins to decrease, until the intermolecular force (the net force of attractive + repulsive) acting on the molecules becomes zero. The separation between the molecules when the intermolecular force becomes zero is known as the **equilibrium separation**. This spacing is approximately the distance between molecules in liquids and solids. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the separation between the molecules becomes less than the equilibrium distance, the force acting on the molecules becomes repulsive. The gradient of this repulsive force as a function of distance is much steeper than the attractive force, therefore only a small compression beyond the equilibrium distance corresponds to a large increase in the repulsive force acting between the molecules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As these forces are a function of distance we can safely assume that we are actually witnessing the effect of two independent forces and the intermolecular force is simply the net force acting on the molecules. Clearly at small distances, the repulsive force dominates. You don't need to know the underlying derivation or model for this, but one of the most successful models of this two-force system is known as the Lennard-Jones potential shown in {numref}`fig_LJPot` below.\n",

    "### Thermal Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the intermolecular potential plot to explain why materials expand when they are heated.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/ThermalExpansionPlot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this plot you will notice that the shape of the potential well is asymmetric around $r_0$ as the repulsive force is stronger than the attractive force at short distances (see {numref}`fig_LJPot` for a visual reminder). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solids\n",
    "First, let us thing about solids. Solids are made up of atoms arranged in a lattice, constantly vibrating around their equilibrium positions.  Even at low temperatures, these vibrations occur due to the inherent thermal energy.  Increasing the temperature means giving the atoms more energy, causing them to vibrate with larger amplitudes. However we've seen that the potential well is steeper on the repulsive side and shallower on the attractive side. This asymmetry is the key to thermal expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the atoms vibrate with larger amplitudes (due to the increased temperature), they explore a wider range of the potential well. Because of the asymmetry, they spend slightly more time at larger interatomic separations than at compressed ones.  While they experience both attractive and repulsive forces, the shallower attractive side allows for a greater average separation.  \n",
    "Think of it this way: the atoms can move further apart more easily than they can be squeezed together.  While they oscillate back and forth, the average distance between them increases with increasing vibrational amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "This increase in average interatomic distance is what we observe as thermal expansion. The solid expands because, collectively, the atoms are spaced slightly further apart. It's a direct consequence of the increased thermal vibrations coupled with the asymmetric nature of the interatomic potential well.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Heating a metal sheet with a hole in the middle\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "When a solid expands due to heating, it expands in all directions.  This includes any \"negative space\" within the solid, such as a hole in the middle of a solid sheet.  It's a common misconception that the hole might shrink as the surrounding material expands inwards.  However, this is incorrect.\n",
    "```{figure} Figures/Hole_Expansion.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "Consider the atomic view (middle image).  Heating the material increases the average separation between all atoms.  This increased spacing applies equally to the atoms bordering the hole.  As these atoms move outwards, the hole they define also expands (rightmost image).\n",
    "\n",
    "The hole expands because the material itself is expanding uniformly. It's not that the expansion pushes inwards; rather, the expanding atomic lattice effectively \"stretches\" the hole along with it.  The hole behaves as if it were made of the same material as the sheet; it expands by the same proportion.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Liquids\n",
    "In liquids, the intermolecular distances are slightly greater than in the corresponding solid phase, but the key difference is the **lack of long-range order**. While there might be small, transient clusters of molecules with some local structure, liquids don't have the rigid, extended lattice of a solid. The molecules have much greater freedom of movement, constantly jostling and rearranging.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we increase the temperature of a liquid, the molecules gain kinetic energy and move more vigorously. This increased motion leads to **larger average intermolecular separations**, just as in solids. However, because liquids lack the fixed structure of a solid, the expansion isn't as constrained. The increased freedom of movement allows the molecules to spread out more readily, and the thermal expansion of liquids is generally greater than that of solids. The same principle of an asymmetric intermolecular potential still applies, but its effect is more pronounced due to the greater freedom of movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gases\n",
    "Gases are characterised by widely separated molecules with very weak intermolecular forces. In the ideal gas model, we even neglect these forces entirely. Increasing the temperature of a gas dramatically increases the kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to much greater speeds and, consequently, a larger average separation between molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the intermolecular forces are so weak (or negligible in the ideal gas case), the expansion of a gas is primarily driven by the increased kinetic energy of the molecules. The molecules simply fly further apart when they have more energy. This is why gases exhibit the largest thermal expansion coefficients compared to solids and liquids. The expansion is not constrained by any lattice structure or significant intermolecular forces, so the molecules are free to occupy a much larger volume.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dissociation energy, $\\epsilon$, is the amount of energy required to break the intermolecular bonds between a pair of molecules in a substance. Of course this only applies to a single pair of molecules, so we can scale it up to consider breaking apart all of the pair-bonds to turn a solid into an ideal gas (no intermolecular interactions). This process of changing state from solid to gas is sublimation as so we can relate $\\epsilon$ to the latent heat of sublimation of the substance, $L_\\text{SM}$, using the equation:\n",

By considering how much thermal energy a material poses with respect to the dissociation energy, we are able to categorise it into three different types of matter: cold matter, moderate temperature or high temperature.

    "The example given on the previous slides are all types of static deformation e.g. deformation under a static load. \n",

It is understandable that the performance of the material will change over the lifetime of the product until it is no longer capable of serving its intended purpose, meaning it requires replacement. \n",

Each flight the components of the aircraft will experience these forces over and over again. \n",

    "When designing the plane, engineers need to take into account material fatigue, which is the weakening of a material caused by cyclical stresses and strains on the material (e.g. applying forces over and over again).
