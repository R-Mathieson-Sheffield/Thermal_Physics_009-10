The size of the atom is given by the orbit of the outer most electrons, which itself is approximately 10000 times larger than the size of the nucleus!\n",

    "The number of protons in the nucleus dictates what **element** the atoms is. For example if an atom has 6 protons it is carbon, whereas if it has 8 it is oxygen. In a neutrally charged atom there are the same number of protons as electrons. The electron configuration of an atom dictate how it will interact with other atoms (e.g. for bonds etc). This is where physics becomes chemistry.\n",

    "The molecules forming an oil film are determined to have a size of approximately $0.60 \\times 10^{-10}\\text{ m}$ using the oil drop method. If the radius of the drop of oil was $0.15\\text{ mm}$, determine the radius of the circular oil film formed on the surface of the water.\n",

    "This is a reworking of the [oil drop calculation](L1_OilDrop) shown previously.  \n",

    "Be careful of the different units used in the question, and that the question is specifically using and requesting **radii** rather than diameters.\n",
